# C Programming Language Projects

Module of **System engineering** and **Devops**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX SE](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.

## PROJECTS
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies using C language:

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0x00-hello_world`](https://github.com/alex-m-kimeu/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world) | It aims to help us learn about basics of C programming language |
| [`0x01-variables_if_else_while`](https://github.com/alex-m-kimeu/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while) | It aims to help us learn about variables, logical operators, Decision Control statement and Loop control statements |
| [`0x02-functions_nested_loops`](https://github.com/alex-m-kimeu/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops) | It aims to help us learn about nested loops, functions and how to use them and the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function |
| [`0x03-debugging`](https://github.com/alex-m-kimeu/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging) | It aims to help us learn how to debugg codes manually |
